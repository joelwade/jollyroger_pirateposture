I've added this update file so we can document what updates we've made to the app.

I've also added 4 new activities; PlotterActivity, DeciderActivity, AddToPatientActivity and CreatePatientActivity.
I've also created layouts for each of these activities.

I've added a button to the camera fragment that will link to the camera activity, a bigger screen is better for taking pictures and plotting small points on an image.
I've also added the storyboard to the drawable folder so you can get an idea of the route the user will take through the app.
